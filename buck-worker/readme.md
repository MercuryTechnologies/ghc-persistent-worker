# Buck2 persistent worker daemon

This code is a companion app for the experimental implementation of a native persistent worker, which is currently
located in our fork of the [Buck2
prelude](https://github.com/MercuryTechnologies/buck2-prelude/tree/tek/persistent-ghc-toolchain/haskell/worker).

For an example project using it, check out [the Culture
Repo](https://github.com/MercuryTechnologies/the-culture-repo/blob/tek/persistent-ghc-toolchain-local/worker/worker.md).
